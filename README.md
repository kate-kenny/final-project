# final-project
 Bridget, Mia, and Kate's Final Project! 

## Abstract
- Disparities in pollution and air quality based on race, income, and other factors 
- Isolate factors to see how well we can predict pollution 
- see what factors influence
- show experiments

## Motivation and Question

- We have a scientific data set 
- 3 data sets we are hoping to merge 
- Census, EPA, income data
- Interested in bias both in algorithms and in the real world through environmental issues 
- Could inform resource allocation, new building projects, choosing whether to invest in properties

## Planned Deliverables
If everything works outs exactly as we planned we will produce the following deliverables
- A combined data set: We currently have 3 different data sets - one with environmental data by county, one with racial demographic data by county and one with income data by county. We hope to clean these data sets and eventually merge the three of them into one large data set.
- A Python package containing all code used for algorithms and analysis. We hope to create a predictive model that predicts whether a given location is a high pollution or low pollution area. 
- A Jupyter Notebook with experimental graphics. We hope to do some experimentation to determine which factors have the heaviest contribution to the prediction.

If things don't go directly as planned we will produce the following deliverables:
- A combined data set
- A Python package containing our code and predictive model
- A Jupyter notebook. However, our experiments and analysis may not be flushed out to a deep level. We might not have as many visualizations or research on environmental racism or factor contributions.

## Resources Required

- Census Data 
- Income Data 
- Possible meeting with Phil about using Python census package and some additional data help 
- https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/sogun3/uspollution
- https://pypi.org/project/CensusData/

## What We Will Learn

- 

## Risk Statement

- Data cleaning and joining taking too long 
- Patterns expected not happening would make analysis much more difficult

## Ethics Statement

- Benefit: People in highly poluted areas, government decision makers
- Excluded/Harmed: Resident could be excluded if areas determined to be undesirable or bad because of pollution, reinforce existing disparities if it led to people not wanting to live, buy, or invest in those places 
- Hopefully yes, could lead to better allocations of resources. Environmental spending is increasing so we could hopefully direct that money in an equitable way that takes into account systemic oppression. 

## Tentative Timeline

- 3 week check in: Data cleaned, exploratory phase, features somewhat settled on, starting the modelling process to see what models are the best
- 6 week: Graphs, analysis, everything in one Jupyter Notebook
