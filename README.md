# final-project
 Bridget, Mia, and Kate's Final Project! 

## Abstract

Our project address the problems of disparities in pollution and air quality based on race, income, and other factors. Our overall approach will be to isolate factors to see how well we can predict pollution and see what factors influence the amount of pollution in an area. We will evaluate our success against our stated goals by using visual cues such as graphs, analysis, and the source code to demonstrate the experiments we have done with the data. 


## Motivation and Question

- We have a scientific data set 
- 3 data sets we are hoping to merge 
- Census, EPA, income data
- Interested in bias both in algorithms and in the real world through environmental issues 
- Could inform resource allocation, new building projects, choosing whether to invest in properties

The initial motivation for our project was coming across a data set of EPA air pollution from 2000-2020 that has records of different types of pollutants on a national, state, and county level. From there, we wanted to work on something related to that data set and all three of us had an interest in working on a project that considered bias as a key component. So we landed on the idea of working with the EPA data set in addition to census data about the demographics of different areas to explore what factors are most highly corrolated with pollution. Additionaly, this project is an opportunity to explore algorithmic bias once we complete our modelling process. 

## Planned Deliverables

- Combined Data Set
- Python package 
- Jupyter Notebook with graphs/figures and a pretty large amount of writing 

- Full success: Working prediction model, analysis of what factors are related to pollution rates, outside reasearch
- Partial success: Same but less analysis/outside research about environmental racism/disparities, still python package and less developed Jupyter notebook

## Resources Required

- Census Data 
- Income Data 
- Possible meeting with Phil about using Python census package and some additional data help

- https://pypi.org/project/CensusData/

## What We Will Learn

- 

## Risk Statement

- Data cleaning and joining taking too long 
- Patterns expected not happening would make analysis much more difficult

## Ethics Statement

The groups that stand to benefit from our project include people in highly polluted areas, as the outcome of this experiment could highlight the disparities between different groups of people and air quality and therefore spur lawmakers to allocate resources more liberally to those places. Government decision makers could also benefit from our project as it provides evidence to justify spending money in certain areas. 
The groups that stand to be excluded or harmed also include the people in highly polluted areas. We thinkt hat if our project is used in a biased way, it could be used to justify not buying, investing, or building in certain areas. If an area is known to be polluted, that area will not be desirable as a place to live or raise children. This could drive money away from these areas and be very harmful for the people already living there; it could increase already-existing disparities. 
However, we are hopeful that the world will become an overall better place because of our project. This comes allong with the assumption that policy-makers and government actors are well-intentioned, and that they will allocate money in an equitable way to systemically oppressed areas. We also assume that environmental spending is increasing in the government and that government actors can create effective environmental policy that passes through both the House and Senate. 


## Tentative Timeline

Our tentative timeline is to have: by the three week check-in: the data cleaned and in one dataset, exploratory phase of playing around with the data and features done, a few features selected (with potential to drop or add features as we go on), and the beginning of the modelling process to determine which models we should use. By the six week check in: graphs, analysis, and code all in one Jupyter Notebook with a clear story being told (whether we find results we are expecting or not).
