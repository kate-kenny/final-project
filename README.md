# Predicting Air Pollution Based on Census Data

## Mia Tarantola, Bridget Ulian, and Kate Kenny  

## Abstract

Our project address the problems of disparities in pollution and air quality based on race, income, and other factors. Our overall approach will be to isolate factors to see how well we can predict pollution and see what factors influence the amount of pollution in an area. We will evaluate our success against our stated goals by using visual cues such as graphs, analysis, and the source code to demonstrate the experiments we have done with the data. 


## Motivation and Question


The initial motivation for our project was coming across a data set of EPA air pollution from 2000-2020 that has records of different types of pollutants on a national, state, and county level. From there, we wanted to work on something related to that data set and all three of us had an interest in working on a project that considered bias as a key component. So we landed on the idea of working with the EPA data set in addition to census data about the demographics of different areas to explore what factors are most highly corrolated with pollution. This project is an opportunity for us to learn more about environmental racism in addition to exploring algorithmic bias once we complete our modelling process. We think that this model could inform resource allocation from the government, new building projects that could cause pollution, and other future investments from both the private and public sectors.

## Planned Deliverables

- Combined Data Set
- Python package 
- Jupyter Notebook with graphs/figures and a pretty large amount of writing 

- Full success: Working prediction model, analysis of what factors are related to pollution rates, outside reasearch
- Partial success: Same but less analysis/outside research about environmental racism/disparities, still python package and less developed Jupyter notebook

## Resources Required

- Census Data 
- Income Data 
- Possible meeting with Phil about using Python census package and some additional data help

## What We Will Learn

Kate: In my initial reflective goal setting I wrote that I wanted to work on a project that interested me and ideally would be related to an environmental issue or algorithmic bias. I think that this project offers both and I am excited to move forward with it and hopefully achieve my process goals. I am excited to be working with my team so I think that achieving my goals of open communication and regular meetins will be very achievable, and even fun! I hope to learn more about some of the models we have implemented and specifically how to use our machine learning models on more complex data sets. 

Bridget: Our project aligns with my beginning-of-semester goals rather well. I stated that I wanted to study "a complex dataset in depth and how that affects algorithmic bias in a certain field," and our project includes putting together a complex dataset to determine whether disparities exists in urban air pollution. I am excited to learn how to clean data, and one of my goals was meeting with Phil if we get stuck and I think this is a good opportunity to practice that. I am happy to be working with my group and think meeting weekly will be possible and even enjoyable. 

## Risk Statement

We think that the main risk our project faces is running into more difficulties than anticipated when cleaning our data and combining multiple data sets. That is something that we have less experience with and could potentially end up taking time away from our more interesting modelling decisions and analysis. A second possible risk is the patterns that we expect to arise surrounding air pollution not happening. This would make our predictions less useful and our analysis would be much more difficult. 

## Ethics Statement



- Benefit: People in highly poluted areas, government decision makers
- Excluded/Harmed: Resident could be excluded if areas determined to be undesirable or bad because of pollution, reinforce existing disparities if it led to people not wanting to live, buy, or invest in those places 
- Hopefully yes, could lead to better allocations of resources. Environmental spending is increasing so we could hopefully direct that money in an equitable way that takes into account systemic oppression. 

## Tentative Timeline

Our tentative timeline is to have:
By the three week check-in: the data cleaned and in one dataset, exploratory phase of playing around with the data and features done, a few features selected (with potential to drop or add features as we go on), and the beginning of the modelling process to determine which models we should use. 
By the six week check in: graphs, analysis, and code all in one Jupyter Notebook with a clear story being told (whether we find results we are expecting or not).
