# final-project
 Bridget, Mia, and Kate's Final Project! 

## Abstract

Our project address the problems of disparities in pollution and air quality based on race, income, and other factors. Our overall approach will be to isolate factors to see how well we can predict pollution and see what factors influence the amount of pollution in an area. We will evaluate our success against our stated goals by using visual cues such as graphs, analysis, and the source code to demonstrate the experiments we have done with the data. 


## Motivation and Question

- We have a scientific data set 
- 3 data sets we are hoping to merge 
- Census, EPA, income data
- Interested in bias both in algorithms and in the real world through environmental issues 
- Could inform resource allocation, new building projects, choosing whether to invest in properties

## Planned Deliverables

- Combined Data Set
- Python package 
- Jupyter Notebook with graphs/figures and a pretty large amount of writing 

- Full success: Working prediction model, analysis of what factors are related to pollution rates, outside reasearch
- Partial success: Same but less analysis/outside research about environmental racism/disparities, still python package and less developed Jupyter notebook

## Resources Required

- Census Data 
- Income Data 
- Possible meeting with Phil about using Python census package and some additional data help

- https://pypi.org/project/CensusData/

## What We Will Learn

- 

## Risk Statement

- Data cleaning and joining taking too long 
- Patterns expected not happening would make analysis much more difficult

## Ethics Statement



- Benefit: People in highly poluted areas, government decision makers
- Excluded/Harmed: Resident could be excluded if areas determined to be undesirable or bad because of pollution, reinforce existing disparities if it led to people not wanting to live, buy, or invest in those places 
- Hopefully yes, could lead to better allocations of resources. Environmental spending is increasing so we could hopefully direct that money in an equitable way that takes into account systemic oppression. 

## Tentative Timeline

Our tentative timeline is to have: by the three week check-in: the data cleaned and in one dataset, exploratory phase of playing around with the data and features done, a few features selected (with potential to drop or add features as we go on), and the beginning of the modelling process to determine which models we should use. By the six week check in: graphs, analysis, and code all in one Jupyter Notebook with a clear story being told (whether we find results we are expecting or not).
